# Issue: vue-router per route transition

## Description
When using a [per-route Transition](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/transitions.html#per-route-transition) how can I wait for one transition to finish before render the second component?

The [Transition Modes](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Modes) doesn't seem to works in that case.
